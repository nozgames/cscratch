## thoughts
- can we have the import just create a manifest of all assets and then we can preallocate for them.
- if in the future we need to support paging assets in/out we could create "bundles"
- we should be using our allocators more 
- allocator passed to the object_create 
- when loading by a name just scan for matching keys in the texture list
